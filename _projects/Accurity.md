# Introduction
Please use [Accucopy](https://github.com/polyactis/Accucopy) instead, Accurity's successor.

[Accurity](https://github.com/polyactis/Accurity) {% cite Luo2018Accurity %} is a computational method that infers tumor purity and tumor cell ploidy from tumor-normal WGS (whole exome will probably work too) data by jointly modelling SCNAs and heterozygous germline single-nucleotide-variants (HGSNVs). Results from both in silico and real sequencing data demonstrated that Accurity is highly accurate and robust, even in low-purity, high-ploidy, and low-coverage (as low as 1X) settings in which several existing methods perform poorly. Accounting for tumor purity and ploidy, Accurity significantly increased the signal/noise gaps between different copy numbers.
