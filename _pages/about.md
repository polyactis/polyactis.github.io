Since 2022, I have been Senior Director of Bioinformatics at [Genecast Corp Ltd.](http://www.genecast.com.cn/), working on algorithm development and modelling (算法和模型开发) in cancer therapy selection, prognosis and monitoring, early screening (肿瘤用药选择、预后、早筛). From 2015, I have been a Principal Investigator and Director of Bioinformatics at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica (SIMM) Chinese Academy of Sciences. My interest is developing fast and accurate models, algorithms, distributed computing platforms, and larg-scale databases in bioinformatics, AI-aided drug design, other data-modelling fields.

I was formerly a bioinformatics scientist at [Illumina Inc](http://www.illumina.com/) (San Diego site), and PostDoc at Human Genetics, UCLA. I completed my Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at USC, working primarily on statistical methods in association mapping and population genetics of Arabidopsis thaliana, under the supervision of Magnus Nordborg. I had also worked on gene function/network inference graph theory algorithms. Being in a PhD program founded by a mathematician (M.S. Waterman), I learnt all I can about statistics and probability. In July 2003, I received B.S. of Biology from Fudan University. Fascinated with computers since I tested my first BASIC program on an Intel-8088 PC in my 8th grade, I learnt C/C++, PostgreSQL, Java, Python, and everything about Linux in my undergraduate.

In my spare time, I read broadly and enjoy sports that involve elongated boards: surfboards, skateboards (Original Apex 34, Landyachtz Grom Race, Dinghy), and snowboards.
